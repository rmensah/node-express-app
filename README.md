# node-express-app
This is a Node Express App that looks and acts like a single page app, but it's not a single page app

Eat-Da-Burger! is a fun single page app, that lets the user input the name of a burger they want to eat and submit; once submited it's displayed in text on the left side of the page where it's waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. Once clicked the burger text will move it to the right side of the page. Everything entered will be stored into a MySQL database.
